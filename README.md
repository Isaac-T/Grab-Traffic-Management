# Grab-Traffic-Management
Attempted Grab Traffic Management Challenge by AI for S.E.A


This is an attempt on AI for S.E.A Challenge with submission deadline on 17 June 2019, 6.00pm.

Challenge: How may we improve the traffic congestion for Southeast Asia's roads by leveraging Grab's booking demand data?

I initially tried to tackle this problem with regression model. However, i realised that it would not work on seasonal datasets.
Hence, i will proceed to try out time series approach when i have the free time after my General Assembly's meet-and-greet on 13 June 2019, 2.00pm to 6.00pm.
